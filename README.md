# 50Projects-sound-board
Part of 50 Projects 50 days challenge


Working with the HTML five audio tag to create a soundboard.
When clicking a button, it makes a sound effect.
If the sound is still playing and we click another one, it's going to stop that effect and start the next one by using audio tags.
